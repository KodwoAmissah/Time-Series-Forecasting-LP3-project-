Within this notebook, we'll leverage a range of machine learning models to forecast sales.

For univariate modelling will be using statistical models like:
- AutoRegressive
- SARIMA
- ARIMA

For multivariate modelling we will use
- SARIMAX
- LinearRegression
- DecisionTree
- RandomForest

These models should help in the accurate prediction of sales.

This notebook will not contain the dataset named train due to it's large size.
